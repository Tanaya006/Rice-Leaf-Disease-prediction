# Rice-Leaf-Disease-prediction
**Aim** - AIM - Prepare a complete data analysis report on Rice Leaf Diseases and Create a model which can classify the three major attacking diseases of rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot by analyzing various techniques like Data Augmentation, etc.
In this Dataset we have some major and minor rice leaf disease which affect the quality and overall production of rice. By creating a model that can detect the rice disease using the CNN model farmers can separate the diseased crop before the harvesting and take the necessary measure to prevent further.
Please do check out the detailed Analysis report on Data Augmentation techniques used.
